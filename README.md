# 🚀 QuickShelf – Bookmarks, Reinvented

**QuickShelf** is a modern alternative to the traditional browser bookmarks system. Designed out of frustration with Chrome's outdated folders and lack of search, QuickShelf gives you a fast, organized, and intelligent way to save and manage links.

Instead of using Chrome’s default bookmarks, QuickShelf opens a custom new tab where you can:

- 📁 Create your own categories
- 🔗 Save links directly into those categories
- 🔍 Search through your saved links instantly
- ✨ Enjoy a cleaner, distraction-free link organizer

Whether you're saving articles, tools, videos, or references — QuickShelf helps you stay organized, focused, and efficient.

No more digging through folders. No more lost links.

**Save smarter. Find faster.**
